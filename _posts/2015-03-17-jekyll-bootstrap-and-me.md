I had a static page holding my contact information only. The layout was y2k style and quite boring.

Thus I decided to give [Jekyll][jekyll] a try including some fresh [Bootstrap UI][bootstrap].
As there are plenty of information on this on the web, I thought this should be an easy task...

__I was wrong.__

The information you find helps you in setting up a blog that looks exactly like the template. So that's ok.
Trouble starts when you want to customize something like folder names, feeds or layout.
Then you again have to know HTML and CSS.
And if that is not enough also every toolkit the template uses. In my case [Bootstrap][bootstrap] and [Font Awesome][fontawesome].

See this site as a work in progress.
