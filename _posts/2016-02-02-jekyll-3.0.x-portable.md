As described in my previous post, running [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) on Windows is not an easy task.

## Jekyll for GitHub Pages
Now with the latest [update from GitHub](https://pages.github.com/versions/) it became a little easier.

### Prepare

You have to download following:

1. [ruby 2.1.7](http://dl.bintray.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/ruby-2.1.7-i386-mingw32.7z) 
2. [DevKit 4.7.2](http://dl.bintray.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/DevKit-mingw64-32-4.7.2-20130224-1151-sfx.exe)

### Environment

1. create a new folder `github-pages` that will contain our new GitHub Pages environment
2. extact ruby to `github-pages` and rename the created folder to `ruby`
3. extact devkit to `github-pages` into a new `devkit` folder

### Config

In your `github-pages` folder create a new text file `setpath.cmd`:

```
@ECHO OFF
ECHO Adding Jekyll to PATH...

SET RUBY_PATH=%~dp0ruby
SET DEVKIT_PATH=%~dp0devkit

SET PATH=%RUBY_PATH%\bin;%DEVKIT_PATH%\bin;%DEVKIT_PATH%\mingw\bin;%PATH%
```

### Jekyll

Now we can install Jekyll and it's dependencies:

1. open a command prompt (`cmd`)
2. execute `setpath.cmd`
3. execute `gem install activesupport`
4. execute `gem install github-pages`
5. execute `gem install wdm`

### Done

We are finished and can test our GitHub Pages compatible portable Jekyll setup.
